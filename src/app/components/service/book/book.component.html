    <h3>Terms and conditions</h3>
    <p>
      Terms of service (also known as terms of use and
      terms and conditions, commonly abbreviated as TOS
      or ToS, ToU or T&C) are the legal agreements
      between a service provider and a person who wants
      to use that service. The person must agree to abide
      by the terms of service in order to use the offered service.[1]
      Terms of service can also be merely a disclaimer, especially regarding
      the use of websites. Vague language and lengthy sentences used in the terms
      of use have brought concerns on customer privacy and raised public awareness in many ways.
